### Written Questions

Please write your answers for the questions below (see Section 4 of the handout).

**IEEE floating point represents values closest to zero using its denormalized form. All other values, with the exception of a few special cases, are represented using its normalized form.**  

1. **What is the smallest positive value that can be represented as a normalized double-precision number? How much larger is the next smallest value?**  
   Write your answer here!


s = 0 [we make it positive]
exp =  0 0 ... 1 [10 zeros and give the last digit to 1--note that exp shouldn't be 0]

frac = 0 0 0 ...0 [all zeros]
M = 1.<frac>
bias = 2^10-1

the smallest positive value = (-1)^s * 2^(E) * M = (-1)^(0) * 2 ^(1-2^10+1)* 1 
= 2 ^(-1022)


now if we set frac = 0 0 0 ... 0 1 [51 zeros and the last digit is 1]

exp unchanged

so we got the next smallest one = 2^(-1022)*(1+2^(-52));

How much larger?

we do a subtraction:

2^(-1022)*(1+2^(-52))-2^(-1022) = 2^(-1074);

2. **What is the smallest positive value that can be represented as a denormalized double-precision number? How much greater than this is the next smallest value?**  
   Write your answer here!
   
s = 0

exp = 0 0 0..0 [all zeros]

bias = 2^10 -1;
E = -1022;
M = 0.000...01 [the last  digit is 1 , otherwise are all zeros]
smallest positive value of denormalized number :
(-1)^s * 2^(E) *M = 2^(-1022-52) = 2^(-1074); 


If we set frac now is 0...010
so we should get 
the next smallest one:
2^(-1022)*(0.00....10) [the last digit is 0, the one before the last digit set to 1]
=2^(-1022)*2^(-51)
=2^(-1073)

How much larger?
just do a subtraction:
 2^(-1073)-2^(-1074)= 2^(-1074)
